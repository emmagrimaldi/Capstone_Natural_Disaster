PROBLEM STATEMENT


The purpose of this study is to build a model able to predict the damage caused by a storm event in the US, in terms of number of casualties and economic cost. The parameters needed for the prediction would be: location, time of the year, type of storm event and intensity (info that weather forecast usually knows before the event actually takes place).
The model will be trained by using data about past storm events located in the US between the year 2000 and 2018 that caused at least $50k in terms of economic damage. Such data have been sourced from the National Climatic Data Center website (https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/).
